Hey Choom,  

This challenge is based on an Arasaka hack from 2023. You need to click `Use this template` and create your repo OR you can `Fork` this repo. Either one will be fine.
After that you can do a `git clone <your repo .git url>` in your terminal and open up the code in Visual Studio or VSCode.
